To piggyback on rkj's answer, to avoid endless prompts (and force the command recursively), enter the following into the command line, within the project folder:

$ rm -rf .git
Or to delete .gitignore and .gitmodules if any (via @aragaer):

$ rm -rf .git*
Then from the same ex-repository folder, to see if hidden folder .git is still there:

$ ls -lah
If it's not, then congratulations, you've deleted your local git repo, but not a remote one if you had it. You can delete GitHub repo on their site (github.com).
